Time-frequency (T-F) domain masking is a mainstream approach for single-channel speech enhancement. Recently, focuses have been put to phase prediction in addition to
amplitude prediction. In this paper, we propose a phase-and-harmonics-aware deep neural network (DNN), named
PHASEN, for this task. Unlike previous methods which directly use a complex ideal ratio mask to supervise the DNN
learning, we design a two-stream network, where amplitude
stream and phase stream are dedicated to amplitude and phase
prediction. We discover that the two streams should communicate with each other, and this is crucial to phase prediction.
In addition, we propose frequency transformation blocks to
catch long-range correlations along the frequency axis. Visualization shows that the learned transformation matrix implicitly captures the harmonic correlation, which has been proven
to be helpful for T-F spectrogram reconstruction. With these
two innovations, PHASEN acquires the ability to handle detailed phase patterns and to utilize harmonic patterns, getting
1.76dB SDR improvement on AVSpeech + AudioSet dataset.
It also achieves significant gains over Googleâ€™s network on
this dataset. On Voice Bank + DEMAND dataset, PHASEN
outperforms previous methods by a large margin on four metrics.
